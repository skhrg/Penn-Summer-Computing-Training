    "SSH and SCP are network protocols by which two computers can securely communicate, even over unsecured networks. SSH is primarily used for remote log-in (i.e., logging into one computer remotely from another computer) and remote command line control (i.e. using one computer to open a terminal on another). SCP is a related protocol for copying files from one computer to another via the SSH protocol. Both are command line tools, which can be accessed from a terminal on Linux or MacOS, and via Windows on a number of services which provide SSH functionality, i.e. [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/). Both of these services allow one to remotely work on a computer without physically being present at that computer. This is often used to access a computing cluster, such as NERSC, but can be used to connect to any computer. \n",
