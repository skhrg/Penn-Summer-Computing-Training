Exercise
========

Now it's your turn!

You should take the file (`example_code.py`) and try to optimize it 
as much as possible, using the steps we just learned about.

Note that you will need to also download `input_0.txt` and `input_1.txt`,
those are the underlying inputs to the function.

1. Format it with a source formatter.
2. Develop unit tests for it and run them with pytest.
3. Profile those tests using `time` and `py-spy`.
4. Improve the performance of the code.
