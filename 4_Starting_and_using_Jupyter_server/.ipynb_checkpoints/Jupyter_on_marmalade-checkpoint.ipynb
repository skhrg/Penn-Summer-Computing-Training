    "Jupyter notebooks function somewhat similarly to ipython sessions, as they represent a \"persistent\" coding environment in which variables, functions, etc. are stored in memory for the duration of the session. This differs from a script, which runs through from start to finish, with all objects being deleted at the end of evaluation. Whereas ipython has a terminal-like interface, jupyter uses a \"cell\" based interface, which you can see here. All code lives in cells, which you can evaluate by pressing `shift-enter` while in the cell. Cells also contain markdown, as these cells do. To create a new cell, press the `plus` button. This will create and empty cell:"
