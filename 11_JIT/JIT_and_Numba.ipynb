    "Just-in-time compilation (JIT) is a method for selectively speeding up Python code by compiling specific funtions within a python script. Remember earlier we said coding languages are either compiled (C) or interpreted (Python). JIT is something of a middle-ground between the two. With JIT, a specific function (or functions) is flagged for compiling at run time. The first time that function is called within the code, it will be compiled on the fly by the JIT compiler. This compiled version of the function will then live in memory, and will be used by later calls to the function for a very high performance increase. Note that the first call to the function is actually somewhat slower than if it were not JIT'd, as the compiler has to do its magic to make the compiled function. However generally even one sucessive call will make up the difference. This does mean that JIT generally shines the brightest when applied to functions that are repeatedly called. "

    "JIT-ing a function is almost trivially easy. First you need a JIT compiler; in the case of Python, these are packages which can be conda (or pip) installed. The two most popular options by far are Numba and jax. Generally the performance of these two packages is equivalent, and they support largely the same features (e.g., direct compilation to GPU, automatic vectorization, etc.). They differ in their backend, XLA for jax vs LLVM for Numba. It's not particularly important what those backends are; the key point is that jax supports one large feature, automatic differentiation of arbitrary functions, that Numba does not support. The trade off is that JIT-ing functions with jax imposes some tricky restrictions on what code you can write (e.g., jax arrays are completely immutable, jax functions must be pure). I would reccomend sticking to Numba unless you know you need the features that jax provides. In that case, reading the [jax sharp bits documentation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html) can help you get the hang of coding with jax."

    "Note the argument `nopython=True` in the above `@jit` decorator. This tells the compiler to attempt to compile the code with no reference to the Python interpreter whatsoever. This is much faster, however it will fail if objects outside the numpy scope are passed to or called within the function. See the above example where a Pandas dataframe is called within `use_pandas`. In that case, Numba will fall back to an object aware mode, which involves the interpreter. This is much slower, and should be avoided if at all possible. In general this involves \"deconstructing\" objects which you pass to Numba. In the below contrived example, we have a data class, which contains the data as well as other attributes such as housekeeping data and the date. If we write a function to take in the full class as an argument, Numba will fail:"
